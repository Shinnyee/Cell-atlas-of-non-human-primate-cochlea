## Contents
In the present study, we employed high-throughput transcriptomic sequencing to profile over 36,701 nuclei across 
virtually all cochlear cell types in both juvenile and adult Macaca fascicularis at single-cell resolution. 
Our analysis unveiled remarkable heterogeneity both across and within cell types. 
Despite a largely conserved cellular composition of the cochlea, glial cells exhibited substantial species-specific diversity, 
while hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons with specialized transcriptional programs were well-mapped onto their murine counterparts, 
underscoring the similarities that persist despite evolutionary divergence. Furthermore, 
we constructed a disease map associated with hearing loss, establishing this transcriptomic atlas of the macaque cochlea 
as an indispensable resource for future in-vestigations in both human and non-human primates.
